## Setup (Debian/Ubuntu)

### Supabase and Docker setup

1. Download and install Docker:
    ```bash
    pip install docker
    ```

2. Clone the Supabase repository:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase
    ```

3. To avoid errors when composing, go to the `docker-compose.yml` file and comment out the line:
    ```bash
    GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_ANONYMOUS_USERS_ENABLED: ${ENABLE_ANONYMOUS_USERS}
    ```

4. Open the `docker` folder inside the Supabase directory:
    ```bash
    cd supabase/docker
    ```

5. Copy `.env.example` as `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Edit the `.env` file to insert credentials, make sure to follow instructions at:
    ```bash
    https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#securing-your-services
    ```

    For a simple setup, change the following fields:
    ```bash
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, ANON_KEY, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, DASHBOARD_USERNAME and DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
    ```

7. Pull the latest images:
    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

8. Remove logflare integration if not required. A sample docker-compose file is included in the developer files.

9. Edit the follwing field inside `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM: true
    ```


11. Start the services (in detached mode):
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

12. Open the Supabase dashboard:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

    In this dashboard, add yourself as a user in the authentication tab.

### Flask setup

Assuming the current working directory is the root of the project:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Highly recommended to set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the environment:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

5. Edit the created `.env` file using any code editor to configure the credentials generated during the finalization of the Supabase Docker setup:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=<SECRET_KEY_BASE>
    UPLOAD_FOLDER=./uploads
    ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=csv

    SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    SUPABASE_KEY=<ANON_KEY>
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<SERVICE_KEY>

    POSTGRES_DB_NAME=postgres
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_SECRET=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
    POSTGRES_PORT=5433
    POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
    ```
